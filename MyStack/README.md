## MyStack

Recall from class the underlying implementation of Javaâ€™s ArrayList. It uses a regular Java array to store data and resizes to a larger array once it is full. Implement a stack in a class called MyStack that uses an array to store data and resizes the array when necessary. All methods should run in constant time, except when the array must be resized (this is still amortized constant time).

NOTE: Your class must implement MyStackInterface for full credit. You are not allowed to use any List object as your instance variable. You are only allowed to use arrays as your data retaining instance variable. Your MyStack must be generic as well.
