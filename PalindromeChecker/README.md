## Palindrome Checker 

Write a class called Palindrome that implements the provided the PalindromeInterface.  It only requires a single method: isPalindrome which takes a String as a parameter. The method should make use of an instance of the MyStack class to verify whether the the String is a palindrome.  Your method should *ignore* all spaces and be case insensitive. The method returns true if it is a palindrome, false if not.

We will test your method on our own input, but it would be a good idea to create your own tester class that instantiates the Palindrome class and checks it against a few things that are (and a few things that are not) palindromes to ensure that it's working correctly.
